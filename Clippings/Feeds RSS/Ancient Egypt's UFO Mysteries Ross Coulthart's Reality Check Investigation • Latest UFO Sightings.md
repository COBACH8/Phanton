Ross Coulthart, an investigative journalist known for his work on mysterious phenomena, embarked on a fascinating journey through Egypt’s ancient ruins in NewsNation’s *Reality Check* series. Alongside his friend, lawyer, and researcher JP Hague, Coulthart explored the enduring enigmas of Egypt’s ancient landmarks, raising intriguing questions about advanced technologies, human consciousness, and potential links to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).

#### Ancient Egypt: A Gateway to Advanced Knowledge?

Coulthart and Hague’s expedition took them to Egypt’s most iconic landmarks, including the Great Pyramid of Giza, where they examined evidence of precise engineering that seems beyond the capabilities of the ancient dynastic Egyptians. They marveled at the pyramid’s alignment with astronomical and mathematical constants, such as the speed of light and the precession of the equinoxes, suggesting an advanced understanding of geometry and the cosmos.

JP Hague highlighted the extraordinary level of precision in the pyramid’s construction. For instance, the perfectly level granite slabs beneath the Great Pyramid continue to defy conventional explanations. He theorized that whoever built these structures had access to knowledge and technology far superior to what was thought to exist during that era.

#### The Unfinished Obelisk: Evidence of Lost Technologies?

In Aswan, Coulthart and Hague visited the site of the unfinished Obelisk, an enormous block of red granite carved directly into bedrock. The tool marks on the granite resembled smooth, scooped shapes, leading Hague to speculate on the use of advanced sonic or acoustic tools capable of vibrating stone into dust. These theories challenge the mainstream view that such objects were fashioned using primitive stone tools.

The logistical challenge of moving and erecting such colossal objects further deepens the mystery. Hague suggested that ancient Egyptians might have employed levitation technologies, as hinted at in depictions on temple walls, such as those in the Temple of Edfu.

#### Depictions of Advanced Machines and Beings

The exploration also delved into ancient Egyptian art. Coulthart and Hague examined carvings at the Temple of Abydos, where some hieroglyphs resemble modern machinery, including what looks like a helicopter, submarine, and disc-like objects. While conventional Egyptologists attribute these images to overlapping carvings (a process called palimpsest), the resemblance to modern technology fuels speculation about clairvoyance or knowledge of advanced technologies in ancient times.

Moreover, at Edfu Temple, they encountered depictions of temples seemingly being levitated by tall, humanoid figures wielding rods. These images suggest energy-based technologies that might have played a role in constructing Egypt’s monumental structures.

#### UAPs and Ancient Egypt: A Connection?

JP Hague shared his personal experiences with UAPs and their possible links to human consciousness, proposing that these phenomena might transcend local time and space. He theorized that ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians, might have had interactions with non-human intelligences (NHIs) that informed their technological and spiritual advancements.

Hague’s perspective aligns with the esoteric belief that ancient Egyptians encoded knowledge about the cosmos, human consciousness, and energy manipulation in their art and architecture. The Eye of Horus, for instance, bears a striking resemblance to the human pineal gland, often considered the seat of consciousness and intuition.

#### Why Does It Matter?

The mysteries of ancient Egypt are not just academic. Rediscovering lost technologies and spiritual integration could revolutionize modern society. According to Hague, the Egyptians achieved a remarkable unity between science, spirituality, and practical life, offering a model for harmonious coexistence with nature and the cosmos.

By revisiting these ancient enigmas, Coulthart and Hague argue, humanity might unlock a deeper understanding of consciousness, energy, and the universe. Their journey highlights the importance of keeping an open mind, bridging the gap between science and the mystical, and embracing the possibility of unknown dimensions of human knowledge.
