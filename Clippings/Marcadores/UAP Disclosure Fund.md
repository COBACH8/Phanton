Admiral Mike Rogers, U.S. Navy (Ret.)

Former Director of the National Security Agency (2014–2018)
- "There are things that cannot be explained... I don't know what the explanation is for those unexplainable things, but I will say **there are phenomena that have been witnessed by multiple people that are just inexplicable by any kind of science, the science available to us**."

Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, U.S. Army (Ret)

Former National Security Advisor (2017-2018)

Mike Rounds

Senator, Member, Senate Armed Services Committee (2015–Present)
- “There is a lot of unidentified aerial phenomena out there. That’s true. And they’ve got pilot reports, there’s various other sensors out there, and some of it is difficult to explain… **some \[UAP are\] really kind of weird and unexplainable.**”

General Mark A. Milley, U.S. Army (Ret)

Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (2019–2023)
- "The American public has a right to learn about **technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena**. We are not only working to declassify what the government has previously learned about these phenomena but to create a pipeline for future research to be made public."

Chuck Schumer

Senate Majority Leader (2021-Present)

Kirsten Gillibrand

Senator, Member, Senate Armed Services Committee & Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (2009–Present)
- "It's clear that the majority, that many of the observations that we have are physical objects from the sensor data... We haven't had a collision. **We have had at least 11 near misses.**"

Bill Nelson

Administrator of NASA (2021–Present)
- “**Well I don't believe they are coming from foreign adversaries.** Why if there were that would suggest they have a technology that is in a whole different sphere than anything we understand, **and frankly China and Russia just aren't there, and neither are we by the way.**”

Mitt Romney

- "We currently **lack data to indicate any UAP are part of a foreign collection program or indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary**... Some UAP observations could be attributable to developments and classified programs by U.S. entities. We were unable to confirm, however, that these systems accounted for any of the \[144\] UAP reports we collected."
