**El almirante retirado Tim Gallaudet, ex administrador interino de la Administración Nacional Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA), anunció en X hoy que se reunirá con funcionarios de la Administración Trump esta semana para discutir un enfoque integral de todo el gobierno no identificado. Fenómenos (UAP).**

His announcement follows the release of his presentation at the [Sol Foundation](https://thesolfoundation.org/) Conference—a research organisation dedicated to advancing the study and policy discussions on UAP—where he outlined the key steps the U.S. government must take to address the issue of UAP policy. 

[Sharing the video on X](https://x.com/GallaudetTim/status/1887519706707321333), Gallaudet framed his upcoming discussions within this broader strategy, stating:

> ***‘My thoughts from the @\_SolFoundation symposium on a whole-of-government approach for the U.S. regarding #UAP. I am meeting with Trump Administration officials this week to work towards that end’***

In t[he vide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MckLRrmzg-g&feature=youtu.be)o, Gallaudet—who served in President Trump’s previous administration—voiced his support for the [UAP Disclosure Act](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/uap_amendment.pdf) (UAPDA), a piece of legislation first introduced in 2023 by then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and his Republican colleague, Senator Mike Rounds.

The UAP Disclosure Act (UAPDA) was significantly weakened during National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) negotiations between the House of Representatives and the Senate in 2023. Despite being reintroduced last year, it ultimately failed to make it into the latest NDAA.

If passed, the UAPDA could have unleashed a process revealing that the U.S. Government and defense contractors possess retrieved crafts, which are, [according to the Act](https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2024/07/11/170/115/CREC-2024-07-11-pt1-PgS4943.pdf), capable of trans-medium travel, instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic speeds, and positive lift.

In the video, Gallaudet emphasized the need for a formal government policy to advance the nation’s interests in UAP and outlined how it could be implemented through:

- A White House-directed policy issued through an executive order or presidential memorandum
- The establishment of an interagency group, chaired by a senior White House official or Cabinet member, to coordinate a strategy and lead efforts
- Legislation passed in Congress aligned with White House policy, ensuring coordination between the executive branch and interagency efforts.

Yesterday, it was announced that Tim Gallaudet had joined the advisory board of the [UAP Disclosure Fund](https://uapdisclosurefund.org/), a political action group focused on UAP transparency. 

Welcoming the news on his LinkedIn page, Gallaudet called on the Trump administration to take action and acknowledge a UAP coverup, which may reveal the existence of advanced non-human intelligence interacting with Earth. He wrote: 

> ***‘Amidst all the churn involving the change in direction for the federal government, there is an even greater issue affecting the nation and society writ large. That is the reality of the U.S. government possessing data and evidence proving the existence of unidentified anomalous phenomena (and the higher-order nonhuman intelligence (NHI) controlling them.***
> 
> ***‘We are not alone, and it is time for the Trump Administration to acknowledge it the decades-long coverup to hide it.’***

[Last year, Gallaudet told Liberation Times](https://www.liberationtimes.com/home/retired-rear-admiral-and-former-agency-chief-calls-for-expanded-ufo-investigation-and-greater-white-house-involvementnbsp?rq=admiral) that the National Security Council —under the President's authority—has the potential to influence and redirect the government's current widely criticised UAP office, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).

Gallaudet commented:

> ***“The Department of Defense moves in the direction the National Security Council says to, and at the direction of the President. A lot of people will blame AARO for not being fully open and transparent.***
> 
> ***“But their direction comes right from the National Security Council - so it \[lack of transparency\]  is coming from the White House.”***

Gallaudet, who testified before Congress on UAP in November 2024, has also underscored (in his Sol Foundation presentation) the lack of coordination among key U.S. agencies involved in UAP efforts, including the Intelligence Community, Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Energy, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. 

Similarly, he stated that Congressional efforts had been fragmented, leading to the demise of the UAPDA in consecutive years.

The new comments made on X by Gallaudet, provide the first tangible glimpse that President Donald Trump’s new administration is open to providing greater UAP transparency. 

Trump’s new administration, is filled with UAP advocates, including new National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz.

In 2023, [addressing allegations from a former senior intelligence officer](https://flvoicenews.com/mike-waltz-talks-trump-indictment-ufo-whistleblower/), David Grusch, of covert and rogue UAP programs by the U.S. government, Waltz stated:

> ***“We have been assured it’s not our systems,” and added, “That means that it’s either our adversaries have things with capabilities that we weren’t aware of, and that we can’t explain, or it’s otherworldly.”***
> 
> ***“Either way, I want to know and the American people deserve to know what the hell it is,”*** he declared.

Last week, during her confirmation hearing, Trump’s nominee for Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, [stated that UAP would be one of her top priorities if confirmed](https://x.com/HighPeaks77/status/1885012387805225227).

***Ab0ve - Tulsi Gabbard, nominee for Director of National Intelligence***

If appointed, her efforts may align with those of the newly appointed CIA Director and former Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, who in 2023 described UAP as:

> ***"Objects that demonstrate technologies that seem to defy the law of physics and capabilities that we don't have as the world's superpower."***

Adding:

> ***“Our role in the federal government is to provide for the common defense and we can’t do that if someone else has technologies that are better than what we have.”***

Secretary of State Marco Rubio appears in a ground-breaking new UAP documentary, ‘[Age of Disclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkU7ZqbADRs)’, set to premiere in March 2025.
